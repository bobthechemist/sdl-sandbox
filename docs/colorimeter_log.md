# Journaling the colorimeter design

*purpose*: The purpose of this document is to log the experience of creating a new firmware package with the help of AI. I am using the socratic_design_guidelines provided in the documentation and will hopefully provide an honest depiction of how the process works.

## Goals

Create a colorimeter firmware module using an Adafruit Feather M4 Express and Adafruit AS7341 10-channel color sensor breakout.

## Additional tools and resources

AI implemented will be Gemini (2.5 Pro) via the Google AI Studio interface.

Adafruit documentation for sensor is [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4698)

## setting up sensor

Prior to SDL framework, I'm checking that the sensor works. two libraries are needed `adafruit_as7341` and `adafruit_register`, both of which are in the standard CP bundle

The documentation for this sensor is incomplete. For example, there is a white LED on board but the documentation does not describe its use. (set sensor.led to True/False and the default sensor.led_current is 4). There are flicker detection routines and apparently a GPIO and interrupt for triggering based on measurements. The first generation of this device will read all channels, individual channels, turn the light on/off, adjust the light brightness, and adjust the gain.

I would like to make color/wavelength relationships easy, but not sure how to implement that. 
- 415 violet
- 445 indigo
- 480 blue
- 515 cyan
- 555 green
- 590 yellow
- 630 orange
- 680 red
- xxx clear
- yyy nir

The firmware design should not be overly complicated give that the sensor requires minimal setup, provides little diagnostic information, and doesn't have a lot of "states". I have decided to add a placeholder state for more advanced collection methods but since I don't know what I want here, it is not completely defined in the template.

I pasted the AI assistant instrument design markdown into gemini, added the current software stack (using all-in-one) and the socratic_colorimeter.md

Here is the response from Gemini 2.5 Pro

Excellent. I am ready to begin. As an expert firmware developer specializing in this framework, I will follow the prescribed process precisely.

### **Step 1: Analysis of Provided Materials**

I have thoroughly analyzed the provided software stack and the new instrument design spec sheet.

**Software Stack Analysis:**

*   **Architecture:** The framework is built on a unified `StateMachine` class. Each instrument is a self-contained module with a single `machine` instance.
*   **Core Files:** The standard structure is `__init__.py` (assembly), `states.py` (behavior), and `handlers.py` (commands).
*   **State Management:** States are distinct classes inheriting from `State`. The framework provides common states like `GenericIdle` and `GenericError`, which should be used to reduce boilerplate. `GenericIdle` is particularly important as it handles periodic telemetry and command listening via the `listen_for_instructions` helper.
*   **Command Handling:** The `StateMachine` holds a dictionary of commands. Handlers are simple functions that take `machine` and `payload` as arguments. They are responsible for changing flags, triggering state transitions, and sending response messages.
*   **Configuration:** There is a clear separation between static hardware configuration (in a `CONFIG` dictionary, attached to `machine.config`) and dynamic runtime variables (in `machine.flags`).
*   **Communication:** `CircuitPythonPostman` is the standard for device-side communication. All messages are `Message` objects serialized to JSON.

**New Instrument Spec Sheet Analysis (Colorimeter):**

*   **Device:** An AS7341 10-channel I2C color sensor.
*   **Purpose:** Measure light across different wavelengths, control an onboard LED, and adjust sensor gain.
*   **Configuration:** The spec provides a `CONFIG` dictionary with I2C pins, default gain, and default LED intensity. I note a minor syntax error (missing commas), which I will correct.
*   **Commands:** The command set is clear and maps well to the expected capabilities of the AS7341 sensor library. The arguments and success conditions are defined.
*   **States:** An `Initialize` state is required for I2C setup. A placeholder `Collecting` state is requested. The standard `Idle` and `Error` states will also be necessary.
*   **Telemetry:** The requirement is to periodically report the LED status.

The analysis is complete. I will now proceed to the critical second step.

### **Step 2: Ask Clarifying Questions**

Based on my analysis of the spec sheet and the software architecture, I have identified several areas that require clarification to ensure the firmware is robust and behaves as expected. Please provide answers to the following questions:

1.  **`read` Command Specifics:** The `read` command's argument is "channel (color)". The spec sheet log mentions specific wavelengths and colors (e.g., "415 violet"). For a user-friendly API, should the host send a simple color string (e.g., `"violet"`, `"blue"`, `"green"`)? If so, could you confirm the complete list of desired channel strings? My proposed list is: `"violet"`, `"indigo"`, `"blue"`, `"cyan"`, `"green"`, `"yellow"`, `"orange"`, `"red"`, `"clear"`, and `"nir"`.

2.  **Invalid Argument Handling:** For the `set_gain` and `led_intensity` commands, the spec defines valid argument ranges. If the host sends a value outside of these ranges (e.g., a gain of `10` or an intensity of `15`), what is the desired behavior? My recommendation, based on the framework's design, is to reject the command and reply with a `PROBLEM` message containing an error description. Is this correct?

3.  **LED Command Argument Format:** The `led` command accepts a "boolean" argument. To ensure robust parsing, what specific format should be expected from the host? Common options are JSON booleans (`true`/`false`), integers (`1`/`0`), or strings (`"on"`/`"off"`). Please specify the preferred format.

4.  **Telemetry Content:** The requirement is to "send led status" as periodic telemetry. Should this telemetry packet include only the on/off state of the LED, or should it also include the current LED intensity setting for a more complete status update?

5.  **Hardware Library Assumption:** I will proceed under the assumption that the firmware should use the standard Adafruit CircuitPython library for this sensor (`adafruit_as7341`). Please confirm if this is the correct library to use.

6.  **`Collecting` State Trigger:** The `Collecting` state is currently a placeholder. To create a useful skeleton, how will this state eventually be entered? Will it be triggered by a new command (e.g., `start_collection`)? For now, I will create the state class, but it will not be reachable. Is this the correct approach?

I will await your answers before proceeding to Step 3.
```

After answering the questions and eating a piece of fruit, I copy pasted the three files that were generated into the firmware directory. I noticed that the template does not provide a suggestion to update firmware_db, so I will make it PID 813 and VID 808  The deploy.py function doesn't work well but the batch file (using xcopy) seems to do a better job.

Once the deployment issues were taken care of, the colorimeter started reporting telemetry data and responded to the read_all command.

I'm pleasantly surprised that the basic operation works fine. I think the template needs to provide some additional detail to the AI about how payloads, functions, and arguments are to be formatted, but since I haven't given that topic sufficient thought, it is no surprise that the AI provides different approaches.
